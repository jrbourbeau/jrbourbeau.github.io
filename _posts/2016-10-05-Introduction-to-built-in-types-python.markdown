I put together a Jupyter notebook that covers several of the commonly used built-in type in Python. The notebook can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jrbourbeau/python-stuff/blob/master/notebooks/built-in-type-survery.ipynb) or [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrbourbeau/python-stuff/blob/master/notebooks/built-in-type-survey.ipynb).
