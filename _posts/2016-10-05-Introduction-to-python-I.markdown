I put together a Jupyter notebook that covers several of the commonly used built-in type in Python. The notebook can be found on <a class='underlined' href="https://github.com/jrbourbeau/python-stuff/blob/master/notebooks/built-in-type-survery.ipynb" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a class='underlined' href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrbourbeau/python-stuff/blob/master/notebooks/built-in-type-survery.ipynb" target="_blank">nbviewer</a>.
