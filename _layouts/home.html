        Hi, I'm James Bourbeau. I'm a physics Ph.D. student, data analyst, and programmer with an interest in machine learning and open-source software. I have several years of experience coding in Python, predominantly in the scientific computing and Python data science space.

        I thoroughly enjoy working with data and building data analysis tools.

        In my free time I like spending time outside with friends and enjoying life in Madison, WI!
