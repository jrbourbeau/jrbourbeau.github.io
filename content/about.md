title = "About Me"
+++

I'm the Lead Open Source Engineer at [Coiled](https://coiled.io/) where I focus on
scalable Python open source computing. I'm also a maintainer and core developer of
[Dask](https://dask.org/), a Python library for parallel and distributed computing.
Details about my open source work are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jrbourbeau).

Additionally, I co-organizer the monthly [Madpy](https://madpy.com) Python meetup
in Madison, WI.

I hold a Ph.D. and M.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I studied
experimental astrophysics as a member of the IceCube collaboration. Previously I
attended the University of Texas at Arlington where I received a B.S. in Physics.
