I'm a Software Engineer at [Quansight](https://www.quansight.com) where I contribute to and help maintain projects in the scientific Python ecosystem. I also work on consulting projects to help clients leverage open-source tools for data science applications. Details on my open-source contributions are available on <a href="https://github.com/jrbourbeau">GitHub</a>.

Additionally, I co-organizer the monthly <a href="https://madpy.com">MadPy</a> Python meetup.

I hold a Ph.D. and M.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I studied experimental astrophysics as a member of the IceCube collaboration. Previously I attended the University of Texas at Arlington where I received a B.S. in Physics.
