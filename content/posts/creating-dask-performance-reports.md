## Dask's dashboard is great, but temporary

[Dask](https://dask.org/) has a great set of built-in diagnostic tools. In particular,
Dask's [dashboard](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/diagnosing-performance.html)
provides a real-time look into the state of a cluster by displaying the tasks which
are current running, the CPU/memory load on the scheduler and workers,
scheduler and worker logs, and more. It's an invaluable tool in helping diagnose the
performance of Dask computations.

However, part of the real-time nature of the dashboard is that it goes away when
the cluster shuts down. This puts Dask users in a situation where they have to take
screenshots of their dashboard or, worse yet, try to remember what the task stream plot
looked like during a certain part of their computation.

## Performance reports can help

Fortunately, Dask has the ability to create
[performance reports](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/diagnosing-performance.html#performance-reports)
which saves dashboard plots, information about your cluster, and the code that was used to
generate the report to a static HTML file which you can refer back to later or share with
colleagues. Having such an artifact is particularly valuable when benchmarking or profiling
a computation or workflow.

## How to create a performance report

Generating a performance report involves wrapping your normal Dask code in a
[`performance_report` context manager](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/api.html#distributed.performance_report):

```python
import dask.array as da
from dask.distributed import Client, performance_report

# Create a local Dask cluster
client = Client()

# Generate a performance report from the code in this with block.
# A `my_report.html` file with the report will be created locally.
with performance_report(filename="my_report.html"):
    x = da.random.random((10_000, 10_000), chunks=(1_000, 1_000))
    result = (x + x.T).mean(axis=0).mean()
    result.compute()
```

This will create a report with information about your cluster during the time the code
inside the `performance_report` context block was running.

And that's it! Go forth and use performance reports ðŸŽ‰
