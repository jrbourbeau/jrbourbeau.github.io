I'm an active developer, maintainer, or contributor to several projects in the Python data science community. Projects I maintain or have made significant contributions to include:

### Dask

[Dask](http://docs.dask.org/) is a library for flexible parallel computing in Python. It provides parallelized NumPy array and Pandas DataFrame objects as well as a task scheduling interface for scientific computing in larger-than-memory or distributed environments.


### PyCondor

[PyCondor](https://jrbourbeau.github.io/pycondor/) is a Python package for constructing and submitting jobs to an HTCondor distributed cluster. It was designed to provide built-in functionality to help automate common workflow tasks with a user-friendly API.


### PyUnfold

[PyUnfold](https://jrbourbeau.github.io/pyunfold/) is a Python package for implementing Bayesian iterative unfolding. It is built on top of the Python scientific computing stack, bringing iterative unfolding methods fully into the Python ecosystem.

I also contribute to other projects such as [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Dask-ML](http://ml.dask.org/), [MLxtend](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/), and more.

Details about my open source contributions are available on [GitHub](http://github.com/jrbourbeau).
